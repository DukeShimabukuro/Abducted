This game was not at all what I had expected it to turn out to. When I first began to think of what my game should be, I thought a good game would be to be a girl that has been abducted, and the goal of the game was to try and escape the kidnapper’s house. Then I was told that the game was not very kid friendly, so I decided to change the plot of the game, and I came up with you and your friend are trying the new “Breakout House” game. I got the idea thinking of Breakout Hawaii, but changed it so that it was a house, not just a room. A time that I got stuck was when I was able to unlock a door, but unable to walk through the door. I was able to get through the door by creating a new one and realizing that if i said “Door is undescribed” I would not be able to walk through the door. The first puzzle was to find a key in the basement which is in the dryer in order to unlock the basement door. The next puzzle is to walk to the utility closet and open the toolbox. There you will be able to open the toolbox and take the yellow key. With the yellow key, you can open up the bedroom door. The last puzzle is to go to the kitchen and inspect the notes on the refrigerator. There you will find a four digit code which can be used to unlock the safe in the bedroom. Inside the safe is a red key which you use to unlock the backdoor in kitchen. When you walk through the backdoor, you win. When I had someone test out my game, I realized that they were wasting a lot of time trying to find their way around the house. When I revised my game, I made sure to add the exits so that the player can find their way around the house. When Mr. Kiang tested my game, I realized that I had a lot of thing not described because I thought that the item was irrelevant and that the player wasn’t going to care about the object, when in reality, the player looked at pretty much every object that was listed. I was unaware of these things because I did not put myself in the shoes of the player. I was not able to beta test a game because there was an odd number of people in the class. In my game, I am most proud about the safe and using the combination lock. I thought that this was really cool since it was something that I had never used in an IF game. Next time, I would commit more regularly and spend more time revising my game and letting more people test my game.
