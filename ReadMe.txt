The setting of my game is in a kidnappers house. You will begin the game in the basement of his house. The first puzzle is to find a key in the basement that will unlock the basement door. This is one of the only puzzles that I have created so far. You will be starting off in the basement like I said and you will have to explore the house to look for ways to escape and to find clues to what the codes are for a safe. What really helps me if I have any questions in inform is going to the Inform 7 Handbook by Jim Aikin.
